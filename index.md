# MCsquares

## Building a 3D component for the web.
MCSquares is a modular dashboard system. The project is founded on kickstarter by Anthony Franco who
was looking for a webgl developper to create an interactive 3D component for the project's site. I work
on this as freelancer and it was a good occasion to play with the amazing framework [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Play whith it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/demo.html).
